      This sample appears to be built with the single-file deployment in .NET.

      Single-file deployment allows all the application-dependent files to be bundled into a single binary.
      The size of the single file in a self-contained application is large since it includes the runtime and the framework libraries.
      The main application and the libraries are contained in the overlay section.
      You may need to extract the runtime configuration files such as *.deps.json and *.runtimeconfig.json files to determines the main .NET library to be analyzed.
